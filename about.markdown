My name is Christapher Lin and I'm a seasoned software engineer with 9 years of experience. My first 6 years of experience were spent at Leidos, developing secure and robust software solutions for our terrain database production team. Leveraging a solid foundation in software engineering, I have transitioned into a back-end web developer role for the past 3 years, specializing in designing and implementing scalable server-side architectures, optimizing databases, and ensuring seamless integration with frontend systems.
